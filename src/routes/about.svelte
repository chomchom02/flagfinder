    Hello there ðŸ‘‹
    <br />
    nice to see you here!
  </p>

  <p>
    As

      target="_blank"

      IÂ´m
    </a>
    working on this app, I would like to address some likely commonly asked
    questions
  </p>

  <section>

    <h2>FAQ ðŸ¤”</h2>

    <h3>What is this about?</h3>
    <p>
      The idea of this site is to collactivly provide information on queer (and
      non queer) identities in one place. It covers different fields and is
      supposed to work as a starting point to talk about these complicated
      topics.
      <br />
      In my opition having a common foundation in our everyday language is key
      to improve how we treat one another in a society, now and in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>XY is wrong / missing some infomation.</h3>
    <p>
      Hey sounds like youÂ´ve found something IÂ´ve missed. Hit me up
      <a href="mailto:diverent2@gmail.com">per mail</a>
      Or on twitter
      <a href="https://www.twitter.com/diverent2" target="blank">@diverent2</a>
      , or open a PR in the
      <a href="https://github.com/diverent2/flagfinder" target="blank">
        github repo
      </a>
      <br />
      Thank you for contributing!
    </p>

    <h3>What language do you use?</h3>
    <p>
      I try to keep everything gender neutral or at least gender inclusive. For
      some description this is pretty hard. So please feel free to
      <a href="/about/#contribute">improve</a>
      the content.
      <br />
      To achieve gender neutral/inclusive language, IÂ´ve decided to use singluar
      "they". If this sounds strange to you, thatÂ´s ok. However please be
      respectful and accept my choice. If you want to find out more about
      singluar "they" hereÂ´s
      <a href="https://iheartsingularthey.com/">
        a good and entertaining resource
      </a>
      .
      <br />
      In some occations I also rely on using the asterisks (*) to indicate
      people who arenÂ´t automatically associated with certain terms.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this project politically motivated?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, and no. While I follow my own ideals and concepts, I see this site
      mainly as an information platform that is not supposed to be opiononated.
    </p>

    <h3 id="contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>
    <p>
      YES! You can give provide feedback or content improvements
      <a href="mailto:diverent2@gmail.com">by mail</a>
      Or hit me up per PN on twitter
      <a href="https://www.twitter.com/diverent2" target="blank">@diverent2</a>
      <br />
      The whole project also is open source on
      <a href="https://github.com/diverent2/flagfinder" target="blank">
        github/diverent2/flagfinder
      </a>
      so feel free to contribute.
    </p>

    <h3>Who decides what makes it into the listings</h3>
    <p>
      For now, thatÂ´s
      <a
        href="https://www.twitter.com/diverent2"
        target="blank"
        title="@diverent2 on twitter">
        me.
      </a>
      To do so, I research the content and try not to be too opionated while
      also trying my hardest to keep the list organised and clean.
    </p>

    <h3>WhatÂ´s comming next?</h3>
    <p>
      First of: More content. Then there is the full release (release: tba),
      including bookmarks and settings and a proper footer interaction. There
      will also be many UI/UX improvements over time.
      <br />
      Other then that, we will see.
      <br />
      Pst: Multilanague will hopefully become a thing soon!
